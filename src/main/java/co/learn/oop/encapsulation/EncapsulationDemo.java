/*
- Encapsulation is the process of binding code and data into a single unit.
- To achieve encapsulation in java-
    Declare the variables of a class as private.
    provide getter setter methods to modify and view the value of variables.
- Advantages of Encapsulation:
    1. Data Hiding: User will have no idea of inner implementation of the class.
    2. Increased Flexibility: We can make methods and variables, read-only or write-only as per the requirement.
    3. Testing is Easy:
    4. Re-Usability: Easy to re-use and easy to change with the new requirements.
