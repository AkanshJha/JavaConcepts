/*
- Abstraction is the mechanism of hiding the implementation details from the user and only providing functionality to the user.
- Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
    There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java-
        1. Abstraction Class (0 to 100% Abstraction)
        2. Interface (100% Abstraction)
- If we have an abstract method in the class. Then that class has to be the abtract class. Otherwise It will throw an error.
- If you are extending an abstract class, make sure you defining all the abstract methods in the extended class otherwise you
  will have to make this extended class as abstract too.
